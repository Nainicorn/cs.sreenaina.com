          Communication over all else // It doesn’t matter whether you’re an
          English professor or a middle schooler, if you cannot get across your
          points in the simplest possible manner, you’ve failed to do the one
          thing that’s required of you as a writer in CS. Simplicity leads to
          better communication and provides a foundation of all knowledge
          transfer.

        <div className="content-info">
          Description is KEY // You must be able to describe in detail the
          approaches and methods done while completing an assignment. Users and
          readers alike, regardless of their understanding of the concepts,
          should be able to comprehend your program and what you did to create
          it. Therefore, it is important to learn to write specific instructions
          well.

        <div className="content-info">
          Use Figures extensively // Because Computer Science heavily relies on mathematics, it is
          important to contextualize your work in order to present it to the
          reader in the clearest and most effective manner possible. To do so,
          use figures. Whatever your work may describe, it is important to provide
          academics with the necessary tools to critique your research.
