// header 

// Make concrete assertions that portray an evidenced claim.

// content 1

// Avoid “I think…” or “I believe…” statements because they introduce uncertainty. If something is truly uncertain, don’t claim it, else be confident in its representation.
// DIFF: In other papers, it’s important to distinguish between claims and predictions; however, in CS, predictions are still made like claims, just with another phrase that indicates that it’s just a prediction (this means there are little opinions in CS papers).

// In research papers, write in an “[A]IMRaD” structure. [Source]

// content 2

// This format allows people to draw the most important conclusions from the paper without having to read the entire thing. It also separates the paper in sections for people with different reasons for reading it.
// DIFF: There’s no need for a fleshed out conclusion in a CS paper because we don’t need to repeat any points from the discussion section that is directly before this; whereas in some other fields, the conclusion is the source of most key takeaways. Similar to some of the scholarly articles that we read in class for our research papers, such as The Kite Runner, the articles were mainly based on psychology concepts, and looking through those conclusions, we saw that they exhibited this different trait when compared to CS papers. Within authorship, STEM fields tend to prefer co-authorship while other fields prefer single authorship. There are different perspectives and values taken into consideration with college writing. 

// header 

// Write simple sentences that do not distract the reader from the primary arguments in your paper. 

// content 3

// Do not use figurative or literary language in your paper because they distract from the main point you’re trying to make. Communication comes before fanciness.
// DIFF: Fancy or descriptive language doesn’t add to the essence of the paper and only serves to confuse. In other fields, this language may be needed to emphasize an appeal through ethos or pathos, but CS papers should strictly rely on logos.
