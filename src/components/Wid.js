                    to focus on academic essays and research papers.

                    However, Writing in Discipline, refers to writing
                    assignments that are tailored to the genres of a specific
                    field. For example, a science course might require students
                    to write a lab report, while a psychology course might
                    assign a case study (Purdue Writing Lab, 0:00 - 2:45).

                    get used to distinct skills such as communication and
                    stronger understanding in their career work.

                    A specific field, Computer science, is based on the study of
                    computation, information processing, and programming.
                    Writing is an important skill to develop for a computer
                    science major, no matter what type of programming projects
                    you are assigned. Rather, writing skills are actually
                    essential for your future career, as it teaches you to
                    explain programming solutions clearly to other peers,
                    clients, or professors. Assignments are usually based on the
                    IEEE style, which is a widely accepted format for writing
                    technical research papers, specifically in computer science.

                    You must be able to describe an assignment or a professional
                    paper in the Computer Science field. Users and readers
                    alike, regardless of their understanding of the concept,
                    should be able to understand how they can use your program
                    and what you did to create it. Not only will they gain a
                    better understanding of the content created, but you will
                    strengthen your knowledge in your specific field CS.
